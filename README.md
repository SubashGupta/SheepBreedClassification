# Sheep Breed Classification:
Developed a sheep breed classification deep learning model using fine-tuned VGG-16, fine-tuned VGG-19, and an enhanced version of fine-tuned VGG-16 to classify the four different types of sheep.

# Results:
In this study, various training parameters were analyzed, and experiments were conducted using two types of training images: full sheep images containing noise and significant variation, and cropped facial images with minimal noise and variation. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning the last six layers of VGG-16 for 10 epochs resulted in a classification accuracy of 93.75% with a standard deviation of 1.93. Fine-tuning the last 7 layers of the VGG-19 for the same 10 epochs has resulted in a slightly higher classification accuracy of 93.87%. But **fine-tuning the VGG-16 by adding a few additional convolutions layers and performing batch normalization and data augmentation have helped in improving the accuracy by 3.93%, making it 97.68% of the highest accuracy. ** This demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the model for on-farm use.

With this model, the farmers can easily classify the sheep and also help me make informed decisions regarding flock management and commercial valuation.
